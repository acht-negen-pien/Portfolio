                <p>I took a critical look at a solution for loneliness in (dementing) elderly: companion robots. These fuzzy robotic creatures imitate animals (dogs, cats, baby seals) without the inconveniences of a real animal. They have performed wonders in retirement homes. Elderly in homes are less lonely as they bond over the new ‘cat’ in the home, and advanced Alzheimer’s patients are finally smiling again. But is it ethical to give this vulnerable group of society a glorified furby to take the loneliness away? Are companion robots really a solution, or are they symptom control? </p>
                <p>
                    Read my essay on the topic below. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card" style="grid-area:4 / 2 / 4 / 3;">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>
                        Earlier this year I passed a poster for a healthcare provider. Depicted on it was an elderly woman caressing what appeared to be a robotic baby seal, looking affectionately into its eyes. The sight of the poster stuck with me. Seeing a member of a vulnerable, generally lonely group of society taking solace in a glorified Furby disturbed me.  </p>
                    <p>
    					I did some research and I learned that the seal’s name is PARO and that he is a therapeutic robot equipped with tactile, posture, light, audio and temperature sensors. It responds to being touched and talked to, it moves, blinks, and coos endearingly. PARO is not alone; renowned toy company Hasbro started a brand called Joy for All, targeted towards older adults. They sell robotic dogs and cats that, according to their website, “work with you to calm your residents' anxiety, improve communication, increase social engagement, decrease loneliness, and provide a better quality of life!”. And it works. Many satisfied customers leave raving reviews, videos show dementing elderly finally smiling and talking again. But what does it say about our society when we are fine with giving elders a simulation of real contact, rather than actual contact? </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that PARO was developed in Japan, a country whose population is rapidly aging, filling up retirement homes quickly. However, the problem of lonely or sometimes even neglected elders is one that is all too familiar. Besides the physical care that elders need, like washing and feeding, there are emotional needs that can be difficult to fulfill, especially in patients with alzheimer's. Animal therapy can be effective at tending to those needs, but animals are unpredictable. Therefore emulating animal therapy without the inconveniences of working with real life animals seems like a great solution. </p>
                    <p>
                        The principles of PARO and the Joy for All companions do not lie in deception. Most users, with the exception of some Alzheimer’s patients, are aware that PARO is not real. In her book Alone Together, Sherry Turkle describes the human complicity in a digital fantasy as the ELIZA-effect. ELIZA was a primitive computer program from the mid-seventies that engaged in dialogue in the style of a psychotherapist. ELIZA didn’t know anything about psychotherapy, but performed as if it did. People who interacted with it knew this, but were eager to talk to it regardless. They were willing to suspend their disbelief in order to engage with an inanimate object. The same happens with PARO. When a user finds solace in talking to PARO, PARO takes care of the resident’s desire to talk to someone, but it does not care about them or what they have to say. Most of the time, this is sufficient. The performance of emotion is taken as emotion enough.  </p>
                    <p>
                        I care about this topic because it reflects a larger issue in society to do with the internet, our phones and social media. As Turkle puts it, this constant connectivity offers us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. Through our phones, we can start and end communication and interaction whenever we want. People are unpredictable and that makes us anxious. We use our phones and other electronic devices to exercise control over the way we socialize, soothing our anxiety but removing part of our humanity.  </p>
                    <p>
                        It is easy to propose a false dichotomy when arguing for companion robots. The question quickly becomes: Do you want your grandparents to be lonely and bored, or do you want them engaged with a robotic companion? But these are not the only options. This quandary removes social and political solutions from the picture, when they really should be front and center. Instead of the question above, we should be asking ourselves thing like: Why is the care sector unpopular to work in? How can we provide more funds for retirement homes? PARO should be viewed as a temporary solution as we get to the root of the problem. </p>
